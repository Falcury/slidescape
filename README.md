# Slideviewer

Slideviewer is a whole-slide image viewer for digital pathology.

## How to build

### Windows
You can build the program using CMake and the MinGW-w64 toolchain.

You may wish to install `nasm` so that the SIMD-optimized assembly code in libjpeg-turbo can be compiled.

All library code is included with the source code distribution (there are no other external dependencies).

### Linux / macOS

Make sure the build tools `cmake` and (optionally) `nasm` are installed.

The following libraries are required: SDL2 (on Linux and macOS), GLEW (Linux only).
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cd ..
cmake --build build --target slideviewer -- -j
./slideviewer
```


## Supported image formats

The viewer has built-in support for:
* Tiled TIFF and BigTIFF (including generic and Philips TIFF variants).
* Philips iSyntax.

The program can also detect and load the [OpenSlide](https://github.com/openslide/openslide) library at runtime. 
If OpenSlide is present, the Aperio, Hamamatsu, Leica, MIRAX, Sakura, Trestle, and Ventana formats can additionally be loaded.

To enable OpenSlide support on Windows, download (or compile) the [64-bit binaries](https://openslide.org/download/) 
and put all of the DLL files together in an `openslide/` folder, and put that folder in the same location as `slideviewer.exe`.

To enable OpenSlide support on Linux, install the library, either using a package manager or 
by building and installing it manually. The program will try to locate `libopenslide.so`, either in the 
default system library paths or in `/usr/local/lib/`.
